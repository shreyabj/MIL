Overall Styling Notes:

Use rounded corners (20px radius) for all cards, inputs, and buttons.

Employ subtle drop shadows for depth.

Icons should be line-based and minimal for clarity.

Microinteractions like hover states, button press animations, and card transitions should be smooth.

Keep text alignment mostly left for readability, center align for headers.

Maintain consistent padding (16–24px) across sections.
